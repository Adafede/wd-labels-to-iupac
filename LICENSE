## File Organization

To clarify which license applies to which files:

**MIT Licensed (Code)**:
- All `.py` files
- Configuration files (`.json`, `.yaml`, `.toml`, etc.)
- Build scripts and Makefiles
- Documentation source files
- Test files

**CC0 Licensed (Data)**:
- All `.csv`, `.tsv`, `.json` data files
- Generated chemical structure files
- Processed datasets
- Output files from the converter

When in doubt, assume code components are MIT licensed and data outputs are CC0 licensed.
